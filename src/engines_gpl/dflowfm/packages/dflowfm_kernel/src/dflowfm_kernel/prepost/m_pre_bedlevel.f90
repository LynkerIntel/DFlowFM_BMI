!the correct one, as if the sloping bed would continue. In this 
!way, when computing the mean of the bed levels at cell centres,
!the elevation at the dowsntream link will be the correct one and
!`hu` will be correct if the water level at the cell centre of the 
!ghost cell (i.e., using `izbndpos=0` is `\Delta x` down from the 
!correct value. Note that it is `\Delta x` and not `\Delta x/2`.

!velocity boundaries

!we want that at a U-boundary the bed level of the ghost cell is 
!the same as that of the second-inside cell. In this way, when 
!computing the mean of the bed levels at cell centres, the elevation
!at the upstream link will be the same as that of the second link. 
!As the water level of the first inside cell is (1) downwinded for
!computing `hu` at the second link and (2) copied to the upstream 
!ghost cell, we will obtain the same correct `hu` at the first link.
!
!For a case of a sloping bed in the positive x direction and a u-boundary
!imposed upstream, `dxz` will be negative upstream, hence obtaining the
!elevation of the second inside cell.
